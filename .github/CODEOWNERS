# This CODEOWNERS file defines individuals or teams that are responsible
# for code in this repository. Code owners are automatically requested
# for review when someone opens a pull request that modifies code that
# they own. Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence.
#
# A CODEOWNERS file uses a pattern that follows the same rules used in
# gitignore files. The pattern is followed by one or more GitHub usernames
# or team names using the standard @username or @org/team-name format.
# You can also refer to a user by an email address that has been added
# to their GitHub account, for example user@example.com.

# By default the Focus iOS Engineering team will be the owner for everything
# in the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence.

# Changes to the CI configuration must be reviewed a limited group of people.
# We narrowed this down to make sure that no changes go unnoticed.
